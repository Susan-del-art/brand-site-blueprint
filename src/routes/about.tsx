          <p>
            I'm Susan Wakarindi, an Executive Virtual Assistant and Operations Partner
            working with founders, executives and small businesses. My path has moved with
            the digital workplace — from administrative and technology skills into
            executive support, operations, marketing, AI and automation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I've learned along the way is simple: most teams aren't short on effort,
            they're short on structure. So my work is to absorb the load first, then
            design it away — the triage rules, SOPs, trackers and automations that keep
            the volume down permanently.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also believe professionals shouldn't be afraid to reinvent themselves.
            Alongside client work I share practical lessons with virtual assistants,
            freelancers and women building digital careers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work in East Africa Time, which overlaps comfortably with European mornings
            and early US hours, and I communicate in short, predictable updates so you
            never have to chase me for a status.
